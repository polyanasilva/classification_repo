# Study Repository — Classification with Supervised Learning
> 🚧 This repository is currently under development. New notebooks and updates will be added soon.

## Overview
This repository gathers the projects and experiments developed during my studies in the Classification courses from Alura.

The goal is to document the learning process and practical application of supervised learning techniques, exploring different approaches and classification models.

Each notebook provides a step-by-step explanation, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning;
- Class balancing (oversampling and undersampling);
- Training and evaluation of supervised models;
- Analysis and comparison of performance metrics;
- Interpretation of the obtained results.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.13.0**
- **Pandas** — data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** — implementation of classification algorithms and metrics
- **Matplotlib** — data and result visualization
- **Imbalanced-learn** — class balancing techniques

## Repository Structure

```bash
